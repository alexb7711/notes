# Linux `tcpdump`
`tcpdump` is a powerful command-line utility used for capturing and analyzing network traffic on a Linux system. It allows users to capture, display, and analyze packets transmitted and received over a network. Administrators and security professionals commonly use `tcpdump` for network traffic debugging and to examine network activity in detail.

To start using `tcpdump`, you can run the command without any options to capture all packets on the default network interface. However, capturing all traffic can generate an overwhelming amount of data, so itâ€™s common to specify an interface with the -i option. For example, `sudo` `tcpdump -i eth0` starts capturing all packets on the `eth0` interface.

`tcpdump` supports extensive filtering capabilities, allowing you to capture only the traffic of interest. For instance, to capture only the traffic on TCP port 80, you can use `sudo tcpdump -i eth0 tcp port 80`.

You can also save captured packets into a file for later analysis. The command `sudo` `tcpdump -i eth0 -w captured_packets.pcap` captures packets and saves them to a file named `captured_packets.pcap`.

To read captured packets from a file, you can use `sudo tcpdump -r captured_packets.pcap`.

`tcpdump` can also be used to filter packets based on source and destination IP addresses and ports. For example, to capture packets related to a specific host, you can use `sudo` `tcpdump host 192.168.1.1`.

Additionally, `tcpdump` can filter packets based on various flags, such as SYN, ACK, RST, and PUSH. For instance, to isolate packets with both the SYN and ACK flags set, you can use `tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 4!=0'`.

`tcpdump` is available on most Linux distributions and macOS, and it is often pre-installed. If it is not present on your system, you can install it using your preferred package manager. For Red Hat-based distributions, you can use dnf install `tcpdump`, and for Debian-based distributions, you can use apt install `tcpdump`.

`tcpdump` outputs information for each captured packet on a new line, including a timestamp, source and destination IP addresses and ports, flags, sequence numbers, acknowledgment numbers, window size, options, and data length.
