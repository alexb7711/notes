# On Sharing and Teaching Works
I have come to a sort of sad truth. More often than not, I get more satisfaction out of completed projects at work than I do at home. Even more interestingly, I can't even say at the time of writing that I am satisfied with the work that I am doing in my current position. I have subsidised my itch for work with being overly ambitious with my personal projects to try and give myself the challenge I really want and need. Initially this idea seemed very counter intuitive.

In my day job I am problem solving, designing and developing solutions, and assisting in coordinating a large team at a systems engineer level (which is out of scope of my on-paper position). The problem is that it's not challenging insofar as its time consuming. So why do I still get more satisfaction out of a completed task at work than I do at home?

Throughout this short essay I am going to attempt to outline the key components creating this paradox. This document exists as a method of exploring my own battle with this problem, but maybe you can find some useful nuggets.

## Structured Problems
- The problem is given to you, you don't have to define it
- While the solution may be open ended, the goal is clear
- Timelines. Things get done and pushed out the door
- People have a lot of different interests and don't have enough time (poly something or other)

Most obviously, a lot of the ground work is done for you. The problem is fully scoped and defined, you just have to create the solution. That is, you get to dive directly into the problem and get your hands dirty. Oddly enough, this is where I find myself stuck most of the time with my own projects. I devise these elaborate plans with ambitious goals. Running off that new project motivation, I tend to immediately start working just to find myself without direction a few days later. Either what was started is too large in scope, to small in scope, or just simply misses the mark all together. While I'm still trying to figure out for myself how I want to handle macro-scale project management, I have found it as foundational to a successful project, especially if you are trying to learn something new. If you are working on something that is not challenging, then this may not be as impactful. But if you are doing something that is difficult for you, trying to define *what* you are trying to do while trying to figure out *how* to actually do it is just going to lead to frustration and an abandoned project.

Something that I don't do for myself is set timelines. This builds from the previous paragraph in the sense that you need a milestone of sorts to achieve to set a timeline. Bottom line is that this more-or-less forces you to do *something* and push it out the door. Shit work is still work. Personal projects are not about getting out the cleanest most efficient thing, they are for *you*.

Another problem that you may be facing is that the things that you want to work on are not focused. By this I mean that, at work you have a scope in which you solve problems. Its narrow, its focused, you know what you are going to get. Hobbies on the other hand can be diverse, and as such you can overwhelm yourself quickly. Even though hobbies may not be related, there is only so much time in a day so pace yourself.

# Shared Work
- The solution you create is presented and tested against the real world (validation of the usefulness)
- Good solutions become great solutions when others are able to diagnose shortfalls of what you created (You can only think of so much on your own, leveraging others is the shortest path to success)
- You have the opportunity to teach what you know (this actually gives you the advantage in the long run because you get better at teaching yourself)

## Perceived Impact
- Self growth (something is always learned even with the most menial projects)
- Evidence of well engineered solutions (time to reflect on your own work)
- Further interest in pulling in you for more work (which is good and bad)

## Conclusion
- Define clear goals
- Set timelines, crush goals
- Share your work
