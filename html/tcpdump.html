<h1 id="linux-tcpdump">Linux <code>tcpdump</code></h1>
<p><code>tcpdump</code> is a powerful command-line utility used for capturing and analyzing network traffic on a Linux system. It allows users to capture, display, and analyze packets transmitted and received over a network. Administrators and security professionals commonly use <code>tcpdump</code> for network traffic debugging and to examine network activity in detail.</p>
<p>To start using <code>tcpdump</code>, you can run the command without any options to capture all packets on the default network interface. However, capturing all traffic can generate an overwhelming amount of data, so itâ€™s common to specify an interface with the -i option. For example, <code>sudo</code> <code>tcpdump -i eth0</code> starts capturing all packets on the <code>eth0</code> interface.</p>
<p><code>tcpdump</code> supports extensive filtering capabilities, allowing you to capture only the traffic of interest. For instance, to capture only the traffic on TCP port 80, you can use <code>sudo tcpdump -i eth0 tcp port 80</code>.</p>
<p>You can also save captured packets into a file for later analysis. The command <code>sudo</code> <code>tcpdump -i eth0 -w captured_packets.pcap</code> captures packets and saves them to a file named <code>captured_packets.pcap</code>.</p>
<p>To read captured packets from a file, you can use <code>sudo tcpdump -r captured_packets.pcap</code>.</p>
<p><code>tcpdump</code> can also be used to filter packets based on source and destination IP addresses and ports. For example, to capture packets related to a specific host, you can use <code>sudo</code> <code>tcpdump host 192.168.1.1</code>.</p>
<p>Additionally, <code>tcpdump</code> can filter packets based on various flags, such as SYN, ACK, RST, and PUSH. For instance, to isolate packets with both the SYN and ACK flags set, you can use <code>tcpdump 'tcp[13] &amp; 4!=0'</code>.</p>
<p><code>tcpdump</code> is available on most Linux distributions and macOS, and it is often pre-installed. If it is not present on your system, you can install it using your preferred package manager. For Red Hat-based distributions, you can use dnf install <code>tcpdump</code>, and for Debian-based distributions, you can use apt install <code>tcpdump</code>.</p>
<p><code>tcpdump</code> outputs information for each captured packet on a new line, including a timestamp, source and destination IP addresses and ports, flags, sequence numbers, acknowledgment numbers, window size, options, and data length.</p>
