# Mutual Fund vs Market Fund
A mutual fund is an investment vehicle that pools money from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. In contrast, a money market fund is a specific type of mutual fund that invests in high-quality, short-term debt instruments and cash equivalents, aiming to offer a safe, stable investment option for short-term goals.

## Mutual Funds
Equity Funds: Invest in stocks and earn money through stock value appreciation. They carry a high risk level but offer
the potential for higher returns. Bond Funds: Invest in bonds and earn money through bond interest payments. They have a
medium to low risk level and provide regular income. Balanced Funds: Invest in a mix of stocks and bonds, typically in a
fixed ratio. They have a medium to low risk level and offer a balance between growth and income.

## Money Market Funds
Treasury Funds: Invest primarily in U.S. Treasury securities and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury
securities. They are considered very low-risk and offer stability and liquidity. Government Funds: Invest in U.S.
government securities and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities. They are also low-risk and
provide a stable investment option. Taxable Money Market Funds (Prime Funds): Invest in corporate and bank debt issued
by U.S. and international entities. They offer higher yields but are subject to taxes. Tax-Exempt Money Market Funds
(Municipal Funds): Invest in municipal bonds and offer federally tax-free income, making them suitable for investors in
high tax brackets.

## Key Differences
Risk and Return: Mutual funds, especially equity and balanced funds, offer higher potential returns but come with higher
risk. Money market funds are designed to be low-risk and provide stability and liquidity, but with lower returns.
Investment Horizon: Mutual funds are suitable for long-term investment goals, such as retirement planning, while money
market funds are ideal for short-term goals, such as saving for a down payment or an emergency fund. Liquidity: Both
types of funds offer liquidity, but money market funds are particularly known for their high liquidity and ease of
access to funds. Fees: Mutual funds may have higher fees, including management fees and expense ratios, compared to
money market funds, which typically have lower expense ratios.
