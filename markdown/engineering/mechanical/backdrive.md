# Backdrive

> A **backdrive** is a component used in reverse to obtain its input from its output. This extends to many concepts and systems from thought based to practical mechanical applications.
>
> Not every system can be backdriven. A DC [electrical generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_generator "Electrical generator") can be implemented by backdriving a DC [electric motor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor "Electric motor"), however a [worm drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm_drive "Worm drive") works only in one direction.
