A managed network switch and an unmanaged network switch are two types of network switches that differ in their level of control, management, and functionality.

**Unmanaged Network Switch:**

An unmanaged network switch is a basic, plug-and-play device that simply connects devices within a network, allowing them to communicate with each other. It does not have any advanced features or management capabilities. Unmanaged switches are typically used in small networks, such as home networks or small office networks, where there is no need for advanced configuration or management.

Characteristics of unmanaged switches:

- No configuration or management capabilities
- No ability to monitor or control network traffic
- No support for VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)
- No support for Quality of Service (QoS) or traffic prioritization
- Limited or no security features
- Simple, plug-and-play installation

**Managed Network Switch:**

A managed network switch, on the other hand, is a more advanced device that allows for configuration, management, and control of the network. Managed switches are typically used in larger networks, such as enterprise networks, data centers, or service provider networks, where advanced features and management capabilities are required.

Characteristics of managed switches:

- Configuration and management capabilities through a web interface, command-line interface (CLI), or Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
- Ability to monitor and control network traffic, including bandwidth allocation and traffic prioritization
- Support for VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) and trunking
- Support for Quality of Service (QoS) and traffic prioritization
- Advanced security features, such as access control lists (ACLs), port security, and IEEE 802.1X authentication
- Ability to set up and manage multiple network configurations, such as IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways

Key differences between managed and unmanaged switches:

1. **Management capabilities**: Managed switches can be configured and managed through a web interface, CLI, or SNMP, while unmanaged switches do not have any management capabilities.
2. **Advanced features**: Managed switches support advanced features such as VLANs, QoS, and security features, while unmanaged switches do not.
3. **Scalability**: Managed switches are designed to support larger networks and can be easily scaled up or down as needed, while unmanaged switches are generally limited to smaller networks.
4. **Cost**: Managed switches are typically more expensive than unmanaged switches, especially for larger networks.

In summary, managed network switches offer advanced features, management capabilities, and scalability, making them suitable for larger networks, while unmanaged network switches are simpler, plug-and-play devices suitable for small networks.
