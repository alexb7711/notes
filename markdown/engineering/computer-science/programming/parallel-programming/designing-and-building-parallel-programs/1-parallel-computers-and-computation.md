## Parallelism and Computing
### Trends in Applications
In summary, the need for faster computers is driven by the demands of both data-intensive applications in commerce and
computation-intensive applications in science and engineering.

### Trends in Computer Design
Clock cycle times are decreasing slowly and appear to be approaching physical limits such as the speed of light. We
cannot depend on faster processors to provide increased computational performance.

### Trends in Networking
