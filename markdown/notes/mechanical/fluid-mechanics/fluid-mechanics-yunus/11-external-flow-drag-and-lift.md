# Introduction
- The velocity of the fluid approaching a body is called the free-stream velocity (\(V\), \(u_{\infty}\), or \(U_{\infty}\))
- Flow over bodies can be categorized as 
    - compressible flow: flow over high speed aircraft, rockets, missiles (\(Ma > 0.3\))
    - incompressible flow: flow over bodies moving with \(Ma \le 0.3\)
# Drag and Lift
- Drag coefficient: \(C_D = \frac{F_D}{\frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 A\)
- Lift coefficient: \(C_F = \frac{F_L}{\frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 A\)
    - \(A\) is normally the frontal area (the area project on a plane normal to the  direction of flow). When looking at thin bodies or airfoils, the planform area is used. The planform area is the area seen by a person looking at the body from above in a direction normal to the body (i.e. top down view).

# Friction and Pressure Drag
## Flow Separation
When a body is a liquid flowing over it at sufficient velocity, there is a point on the body where the liquid separates from the body. The point where this happens is affected various things such as the Reynolds number, surface roughness, and the level of fluctuations in the free stream. When the fluid separates from the body, it forms a separated region between the body and the stream. This low-pressure region behind the body where recirculating and backflows occur is called the separation region. 

- The larger the separation region, the larger the pressure drag

An important consequence of flow separation is the shedding of circulating fluid structures called vortices in the wake region. The periodic generation of these vortices downstream is referred to as vortex shedding.
