<h1 id="on-sharing-and-teaching-works">On Sharing and Teaching Works</h1>
<p>I have come to a sort of sad truth. More often than not, I get more satisfaction out of completed projects at work than I do at home. Even more interestingly, I can't even say at the time of writing that I am satisfied with the work that I am doing in my current position. I have subsidized my itch for work with being overly ambitious with my personal projects to try and give myself the challenge I really want and need. Initially this idea seemed very counter intuitive.</p>
<p>In my day job I am problem solving, designing and developing solutions, and assisting in coordinating a large team at a systems engineer level (which is out of scope of my on-paper position). The problem is that it's not challenging insofar as its time consuming. So why do I still get more satisfaction out of a completed task at work than I do at home?</p>
<p>Throughout this short essay I am going to attempt to outline the key components creating this paradox. This document exists as a method of exploring my own battle with this problem, but maybe you can find some useful nuggets.</p>
<h2 id="structured-problems">Structured Problems</h2>
<p>Most obviously, a lot of the groundwork is done for you. The problem is fully scoped and defined; you just have to create the solution. That is, you get to dive directly into the problem and get your hands dirty. Oddly enough, this is where I find myself stuck most of the time with my own projects. I devise these elaborate plans with ambitious goals. Running off that new project motivation, I tend to immediately start working just to find myself without direction a few days later. Either what was started is too large in scope, to small in scope, or just simply misses the mark altogether. While I'm still trying to figure out for myself how I want to handle macro-scale project management, I have found it as foundational to a successful project, especially if you are trying to learn something new. If you are working on something that is not challenging, then this may not be as impactful. But if you are doing something that is difficult for you, trying to define <em>what</em> you are trying to do while trying to figure out <em>how</em> to actually do it is just going to lead to frustration and an abandoned project.</p>
<p>Something that I don't do for myself is set timelines. This builds from the previous paragraph in the sense that you need a milestone of sorts to achieve to set a timeline. Bottom line is that this more-or-less forces you to do <em>something</em> and push it out the door. Shit work is still work. Personal projects are not about getting out the cleanest most efficient thing, they are for <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>Another problem that you may be facing is that the things that you want to work on are not focused. By this I mean that, at work you have a scope in which you solve problems. Its narrow, its focused, you know what you are going to get. Hobbies on the other hand can be diverse, and as such you can overwhelm yourself quickly. Even though hobbies may not be related, there is only so much time in a day so pace yourself.</p>
<h1 id="shared-work">Shared Work</h1>
<p>No amount of hard work goes unappreciated by the person who created it. A lot of projects derive from a personal need or interest, and that is how it stayed for everything I have created on my own time. While it is satisfying to have that task checked off, it doesn't hit the same when you realize that you have helped or piqued someone else's interest. I came to this realization after completing my master's degree. I have 2 journal articles along with my thesis, and I love revisiting them every now and then and seeing how they are doing.  Beyond that, not only is your work contribution doing work, but it also opens the door for someone to provide feedback. Not only does this provide an opportunity for you to teach what you already know (which is a great way to solidify what you already know), but it is also the catalyst for good to become great solutions because that dialogue has been opened for new ideas.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that work necessitates sharing your work, it's just baked in your day to day; this is not the case for your own projects. You have to go the extra mile to publish or share you work in a meaningful way whether it be creating a video about it, uploading it to Github, printables, etc. This is essentially an entry criterion to give your "thing" an opportunity to be tested against the real world, a sort of litmus test, to validate its usefulness and allow that discussion to occur.</p>
<h2 id="perceived-impact">Perceived Impact</h2>
<p>Along the lines of previous section, having the opportunity to share your work cements its existence in a way. Doing so gives you the opportunity to look back and reflect on everything you have done and get tangible feeling for personal growth.  Similar to the first section, this becomes a feedback loop. By sharing your work, you give it a semi-permanent to live so you can revisit it and get a sense of its impact. To me, that's just added kindle to the fire to keep pushing onward.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
<li>Define clear goals</li>
<li>Set timelines, crush goals</li>
<li>Share your work</li>
</ul>
