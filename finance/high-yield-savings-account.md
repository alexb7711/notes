# **High-Yield Savings Accounts**

A high-yield savings account is a type of savings account that earns a higher interest rate compared to a traditional savings account. These accounts are designed to help you grow your savings over time while still providing easy access to your funds.

**Key Features:**

1. **Higher Interest Rates:** High-yield savings accounts offer APYs (Annual Percentage Yields) ranging from 4.00% to 5.50%, significantly higher than the national average of 0.46% APY.
2. **Low or No Fees:** Most high-yield savings accounts have low or no monthly maintenance fees, overdraft fees, or ATM fees.
3. **Minimum Balance Requirements:** Some accounts may require a minimum daily balance to avoid fees or earn the highest interest rate.
4. **FDIC Insurance:** High-yield savings accounts are insured by the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) or NCUA (National Credit Union Administration), protecting your deposits up to $250,000.
5. **Easy Access:** You can typically access your funds via online banking, mobile banking apps, or ATMs.

**Pros and Cons:**

Pros:

- Higher interest earnings compared to traditional savings accounts
- Low or no fees

**Alternatives to High-Yield Savings Accounts:**

1. **Certificates of Deposit (CDs):** Offer higher interest rates for fixed terms, but require you to keep your money locked in the account for the specified period.
2. **Money Market Accounts:** Combine savings and checking features, often with tiered interest rates and limited check-writing privileges.
