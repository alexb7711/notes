<h1 id="on-sharing-and-teaching-works">On Sharing and Teaching Works</h1>
<p>If you are reading this, more likely than not you are also a person that aspires to create. That is why I love the field of engineering. The only objectives are to ever expand your knowledge and to apply that knowledge to an bottomless pit of problems. The problem is that between projects at work and at home, the itch is never really fully scratched. Just as the pool of problems is bottomless, so is the well of knowledge. Something that I have come to realize is between work and personal projects is my rate of completion. Not only am I completing tasks at a higher rate, they are more satisfying even though they are not problems I am necessarily interested in completing. For a long time this is not something I noticed consciously, but have felt the affects of. But why is this the case?</p>
<p>Throughout this short essay I am going to attempt to outline the key components creating this paradox. This document exists as a method of exploring my own battle with this problem, but if you are reading this maybe you can find some useful nuggets.</p>
<h2 id="structured-problems">Structured Problems</h2>
<ul>
<li>The problem is given to you, you don't have to define it</li>
<li>While the solution may be open ended, the goal is clear</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shared-work">Shared Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>The solution you create is presented and tested against the real world (validation of the usefulness)</li>
<li>Good solutions become great solutions when others are able to diagnose shortfalls of what you created (You can only think of so much on your own, leveraging others is the shortest path to success)</li>
<li>You have the opportunity to teach what you know (this actually gives you the advantage in the long run because you get better at teaching yourself)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="perceived-impact">Perceived Impact</h2>
<ul>
<li>Self growth (something is always learned even with the most menial projects)</li>
<li>Evidence of well engineered solutions (time to reflect on your own work)</li>
<li>Further interest in pulling in you for more work (which is good and bad)</li>
</ul>
