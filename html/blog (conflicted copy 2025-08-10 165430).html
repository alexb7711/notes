<p># On Sharing and Teaching Works
 I have come to a sort of sad truth. More often than not, I get more satisfaction out of completed projects at work than I do at home. Even more interestingly, I can't even say at the time of writing that I am satisfied with the work that I am doing in my current position. I have subsidised my itch for work with being overly ambitious with my personal projects to try and give myself the challenge I really want and need. Initially this idea seemed very counter intuitive.
