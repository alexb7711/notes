<h1 id="projects">Projects</h1>
<p>This is effectively a list of all the projects that I am either actively working on, completed, or just maintaining.
Active projects are those that are <em>actively</em> being developed, completed are projects that are basically going to stay
in the state that they are, and maintenance are projects that are completed, but may receive updates from time-to-time.</p>
<p>Starting to include tasks I want to do in a backlog, probably going to need to update Pymind to make it a bit more clean...</p>
<h1 id="backlog">Backlog</h1>
<ul>
<li>Start YT back up to share dumb projects and the like<ul>
<li>Update channel name</li>
<li>Update the image</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learn how to develop on Windows better: sucks, but gotta do it for work<ul>
<li>Stow alternative</li>
<li>Dotfiles, script organization update</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Organize projects and tasking better (Gotta do some more pymind development)</li>
<li>Autonomous RC plane/drone. This is going to be done in increments, starting small</li>
<li>Migrate stanky (old gaming rig) to Linux and make into a "power" server</li>
<li>Migrate chuggy's (slim HP pc) shit to stanky</li>
<li>Migrate poot's (NAS) shit to chuggy</li>
<li>Migrate current rig back to Arch (OpenSuse is not really my cup of tea...)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="active">Active</h1>
<h2 id="pymind"><a href="https://alexb7711.github.io/pymind/">PyMind</a></h2>
<p>This is yet another static website generator that is written in Python. The website you are looking at is generated
using PyMind. The objective of this project is to be brain dead simple to use and extend while not doing too many
things. We don't like bloat around these parts.</p>
<h2 id="sig"><a href="https://github.com/alexb7711/SIG">SIG</a></h2>
<p>This is a project that I have had in my head for a long time, knew that I wanted to do, but could not really formulate
the use case. The conclusion that I came to for the Socket Interface Generator (SIG) project is to output boiler plate
code to send and receive predefined Ethernet messages (starting with UDP) for Python, C/C++, and Rust. The primary
objective is to be able to write one "skeleton" for the set of messages you wish to send then to have the application
generate all the source code required to communicate those messages to other applications generated with SIG (using the
same messages of course).</p>
<h2 id="vim"><a href="">VIM</a></h2>
<p>No, its not NeoVim unfortunately. Due to work restrictions I have to use Vim8, so this configuration is bulit around that
with absolutely 0 plugins. Everything is written by hand and organized as neatly as possible.</p>
<h2 id="darbs"><a href="">DARBS</a></h2>
<p>My personal port of <a href="">LARBS</a> for my own <a href="">dootfiles</a>.</p>
<h2 id="prusa-box"><a href="prusa-box.html">Prusa Box</a></h2>
<p>This project is an attempt to make an encasement for my Prusa 3D printer. The high-level objectives are to make this a
cheaply as possible, but not have it be fragile as a house of cards. As well as to include other bells an whistles such
as:</p>
<ul>
<li>external power supply mount,</li>
<li>external screen mounting</li>
<li>temperature control</li>
<li>air filtration</li>
<li>multiple filament mounts</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a long-term project that is supposed to be a sort of milestone setter to gauge how far I have come in design for
the mechanical (structural), electrical, and software aspects.</p>
<h1 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h1>
<h1 id="complete">Complete</h1>
<h2 id="sa-pap"><a href="https://github.com/alexb7711/sa-pap">SA PAP</a></h2>
<p>This is part of my Master degree thesis. This is application is written in Rust and is a Simulated Annealing optimizer
that, given a static schedule of bus routes, outputs an optimal schedule for charging electric busses.</p>
<h2 id="milp-pap"><a href="https://github.com/alexb7711/milp-pap">MILP PAP</a></h2>
<p>This is also part of my Master degree thesis. This is the original implementation for optimizing the scheduling of
electric busses. This uses the Gurobi mixed integer optimizer, so unless you have a student license you won't be able to
run this.</p>
<h2 id="emacs"><a href="https://github.com/alexb7711/emacs">Emacs</a></h2>
<p>This is my Emacs configuration. I <em>really</em> tried to make this work, but Emacs is just not for me. There are a lot of good things
I learned from Emacs that I'm porting back into Vim. If you want the old comment that I made on the project its below. For all 
intents and purposes, this project is dead. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the ever-changing configuration for Emacs. I edit a whole lot of text on a daily basis, and obviously have
crestfallen into the blessing/nightmare that is Emacs. This Emacs configuration is supposed to be dependent on as few
packages as possible while being usable. I suck at writing Elisp (and Lisp in general), so this project is a mixed bag
at best.</p>
<p>Contemplating on renaming the project to RuneMacs. The name stems from the Windows port executable <code>runemacs</code>, when I
first read it I read "Rune Macs".</p>
