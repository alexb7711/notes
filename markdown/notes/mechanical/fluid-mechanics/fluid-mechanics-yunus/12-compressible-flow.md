# 4: Shock Waves and Expansion Waves
## Oblique Shocks
There are three angles of interest:

- \(\delta\): The angle from the centreline of the nose to the edge of the object (wedge angle).
- \(\beta\): The wave angle. The angle from the centreline of the nose of the object to the outer "line" of the shock wave.
- \(\theta\): The deflection angle of the surrounding fluid. This angle is equal to half of the wedge angle.
