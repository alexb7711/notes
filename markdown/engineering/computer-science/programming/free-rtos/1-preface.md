# Multitasking in Small Embedded Systems
## About the FreeRTOS Kernel
The FreeRTOS kernel is ideally suited to deeply embedded real-time applications that run on microcontrollers or
small microprocessors. This type of application typically includes a mix of both hard and soft real-time
requirements.
- Soft real-time requirements state a time deadlineâ€”but breaching the deadline would not render the system
useless.
