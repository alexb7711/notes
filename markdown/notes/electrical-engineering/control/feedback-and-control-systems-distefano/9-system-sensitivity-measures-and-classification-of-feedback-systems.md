# Introduction
Quatitative measures of the effectiveness of foodback are developed in terms of sensitivity and error constants.

## Sensitivity of Transfer Functions and Frequency Response Functions to System Parameters
If a system is LTI, we have two useful models

- Transfer Functions
- Frequency Response Function

The *sensitivity* of a system parameter is a measure of how much the system transfer function differs from its nominal when each of its parameters deffers from its nominal value (i.e. perturb the parameters and seed how it affects the transfer function). A similar statement about sensitivity can be made in regard to frequency. How does the frequency response change when the parameters are modified?

Consider a model \(T(k)\) of an LTI system in polar coordinates

$$
T(k) = |T(k)|e^{j\phi T}
$$

The sesitivity of \(T(k)\) with respect to \(k\) can be written as

$$
S_k^T = \frac{d ln T(k)}{d
$$
