and electrical connectors. Can be used on fasteners up to 14mm. Loctite Red: High adhesion strength, considered a more
permanent fix. Loctite Blue: Designed to be easily removable with common tools. Loctite Purple: Low adhesion strength,
can be disassembled with low torque using the same hand tool used for installation. Available in a liquid form, curing
