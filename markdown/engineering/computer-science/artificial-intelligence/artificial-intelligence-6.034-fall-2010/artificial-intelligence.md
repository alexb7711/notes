# Artificial Intelligence

This course introduces students to the basic knowledge representation, problem solving, and learning methods of
artificial intelligence. Upon completion of 6.034, students should be able to develop intelligent systems by assembling
solutions to concrete computational problems; understand the role of knowledge representation, problem solving, and
learning in intelligent-system engineering; and appreciate the role of problem solving, vision, and language in
understanding human intelligence from a computational perspective.
